# Primality Tests
I did this project in the 3rd year of my bachelor degree at University of Cambridge as part of Number Theory coursework. Here we implemet and analyze diffent primality tests including Fermat test, Euler test and Strong test. The file "statement.pdf" and "report.pdf" contain the problem statement and report of the project respectively. The MATLAB codes can be found in the "code" folder.
